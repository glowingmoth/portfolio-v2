  Hi, My name's Thomas Doig and I'm a junior front end web developer. I finshed a coding bootcamp in 2021 that provided me with a Diploma of Information Technology. During the that period I was taught the full stack and the final assignment was MERN stack.  My background was 3d graphics, specifically 3d art used in game development and real time applications.
</p>
<p>
  It's my hope that with my previous experience and new education I will be a valuable asset to your team.
  With a focus on front end my goal is for you to recgognise my current skills, potential and value.
</p>
