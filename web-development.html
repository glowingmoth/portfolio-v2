      Here you will find different web development projects I have been involved in. Some are team based and others are my own work.

        <p>
          Get The Edge was another hackathon entry that Jason Kim and I entered. We managed to get 3rd place. I had an Idea to allow people to see the latest in demand skills as posted in job ads on sites like Seek. When a user logs in they can enter keywords associated with their industry and search hundreds of jobs containing those keywords. The result is a graph displaying how many jobs contain the skills searched for.

        <img src="images/glowingMothMarketplaceThumbnail.JPG" alt="Glowing Moth Marketplace">
        <p>
          Glowing Moth Marketplace was created to test out the viability of selling my 3d assets online. This is inspired by the Unity Asset Store. It features the ability to upload images and files and allow purchases of the file (3d assets along with any associated images.

        <p>
          Buzzy Bee was an entry into my coding bootcamp hackathon. We, (Tyler Hall and I) got 3rd place. Inspired by flappy bird, Buzzy Bee is basically a clone using identical mechanics. It was great fun, and something I would love to do again.

        <img src="images/onlineGardenShedThumbnail.JPG" alt="Garden Shed">
        <p>
          Online Garden is a way for gardeners to share the plants growing progress by creating records and updating them with logs. You have the ability to follow other garden sheds and other plant records. The purpose was to encourage everyone to garden and be inspired by other gardeners that have more experience and can share that through their own garden shed plant records.
